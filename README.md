The game is a platformer in which your death creates an object which can act like a moveable platform. Any sort of death freezes your corpse to the last position it was at, saving the previous 8. For example if there is a gap that you do not have the capacity to jump over, you will want to die to an enemy that is jumping over the hole so that there is a platform from which you died.To climb vertical walls, you will want to die in a stair-like platform so that you can advance.

Additionally, if you die on solid ground, the object can be picked up and thrown as a weapon to get rid of enemies, collect items, or walk over dangerous obstacles. The corpses will also have special interactions like with quicksand, water/lava, and breakable platforms/walls; it’ll sink and disappear in quicksand, flow over with water and lava (but burn in lava), and break walls.

Your objectives will be to have first and foremost to get to the end of the level. However there will be collectibles (cans of tuna) which will gain access to a bonus level at the end of the game where the corpses gain additional properties. For example, the corpses will now provide a higher bounce or become sticky platforms whose bottoms can be climbed on. Collecting all the tuna cans can also  gain access to a new level theme of a cat toy room.

Different levels will revolve around different environments and thus different mechanics. Each level will be made out a series of screens with each screen being its own checkpoint. (Think of it as sonic’s zones, except each level is only a screen)Current environments will be a river level / lava level with the flowing liquid, a jungle with hidden walls / breakable floors, a desert with quicksand and cactus obstacles, and the final level with remixes of each of the first three ones.

Multiplayer functionality, the second player will be a ghost cat that acts like the first player, but can choose to take over one of the corpses if they land on it and press down instead of picking it up. As the corpse it will be invulnerable for a few seconds and then teleport to player one. As a possessed corpse, the ghost can levitate instead of jumping. The two cats should be able to stand on top of each other but not bounce.
