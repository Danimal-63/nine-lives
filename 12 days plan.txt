1	player object 	Assign an array of the possible pngs for the sprites,
	Life counter: decreases every time the cat dies and moves to the next sprite
	X and y coordinates to display the cat
	Tuna count
2	Platform object	Sprite for them
	X and y coordinates
	Scalar to determine what box surrounds it
3	Player movement	Move the player up, down, left, and right, using wasd
	Create 2 checks for interacting with platform
	•	If it is on top of a platform, its y axis cannot decrease, if there is one above, its y axis cannot increase
	•	If there is a platform directly to the left or right it cannot move in that direction
	Make sure the cat cannot move outside of the canvas
	Pressing down in the air should be a fast fall, accelerate at a faster rate
	Player cannot jump again until they reach a platform
	Create spawnpoint x and y coordinates
4.0	Hazards objects	Sprite work for them
	Create objects like the platform objects, instead od stopping movement in the direction, it calls the killCat function implemented below
4.5	killCat function	Freeze the coordinates of the cat and draw a rectangle the size of the player at those coordinates with an altered cat image
	Bind this to the R key to be called on command
	The rectangle should now act like a platform
	When this is called the player is teleported to a spawnpoint which will always at the bottom left
5	Tuna can objects	Sprite work
	X and y coordinates
	Box around the entirety of the image
	Whenever the player walks into the box the tuna can object, remove it from the screen and add 1 to the tunaCount
6 Multiplayer Pt1	Player 2Object	Sprite work (1 alive and 1 dead)
	Movement similar to player 1 except with arrow keys. 
	No life counter, should interact with all object the same, the tuna count should not be separate

7 Multiplayer Pt2	becomeCorpse function	Bind to rightAlt
	When the becomeCorpse function is called, player 2 is frozen at its current position and acts like a platform for a limited amount of time and then teleports to player 1
8	Dog object	Works exactly like the player 1 cat except it can double jump – can jump twice – jump ability refreshed when touch a platform
9	Level designs pt 1	First create an end level object, when entered the player is moved to the next level, calls the next drawLevel function. Save each level as a function that draws the level. Should contain hazards and platforms and tuna cans and be beatable. See the readme for a level example. Make a minimum of three
10	Level design pt 2	Continue work on levels
				When final level is beat send the player to gamer.sex
11	Create main screen pt 1	Draw a screen at the start of the game, make the option to select 2p or 1p.  Clone all the functions already coded to work in multiplayer
	Add in a random 10% chance that when player1 is selected and only player 1 you can get dog instead of cat
	Use the mouseover event to determine when the mouse is over the buttons for the different levels
12	Create main screen pt 2	Continue work on main screen 
13	Make corpses moveable	When “ “ is pressed on top of a corpse the corpse can be picked up and thrown with “ “. It’ll stop when it reaches a platform. 
14	Make breakable platforms 	Breakable platforms act exactly like normal platforms, but when a corpse is throw at it 
14	Make new levels	Use the new features to make new maps
